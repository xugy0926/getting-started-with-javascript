  "words": "Firstly, it is because XinShengDaXue put up this lesson, and I am a student who saw it. XinDa is a fantastic place and I love it, although I haven't known a lot about this lesson, but I believe I can learn much from it.    Secondly, I have heard a lot about programming. This is a world made of CODE, so programmer can make many things by programming. I want to be a programmer, or be a man knowing something about programming at least. I think if my dream comes ture, my life will have more fun and more possibility.    In one word, programming is a kind of magic in my eyes, JAVAscript is a chance for my to get this magic."
