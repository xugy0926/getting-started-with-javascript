# lesson3_第三次作业_交互图

This is the addtional homework for lesson3. The instructor suggested two main points: 
1. two examples about how date transmission between two devices.
2. the most important thing starts with beignning. how to name the varible

compare with how date transmission between two devices, I think that memory work theroy is more important. If news can understand how one line code as date trasnfer between different function. However, they also need to know hwo to change the typre of Date, and make more efficily on transmission. It also need information about global scope and loacl scope. I will wriet one paper for the memory of Javascript.

On the other hand, the basic skill, how to name varible, is most imortant. The instructor says :"One good programmer is use the best way to solve your problem", but I also believe that "Any of other programer can easily understand your code and update them." Before this lecture, I think I can put as many commit in the file and make the variable more meaningful. Recently, I realized that I need to make my varible more formal and meaningful. I need to define not only how this date do but also what is this date. Here is the example:
    var input = ();
    var inputPersonName = ();

第三次课程，讲解数据交换，给出了基本的数据类型，并且引出了数据类型的转换用于其自身的特性：传输效率，储存效率，计算效率。而后讲解了命名的重要性，分享了自己的经验，“要what 不要how”，以次来使声明的更有意义。 同时表示了如果只是声明而不定义的话是没有意义的。

已解决问题：
1. 声明了node.js 是运行环境。（运行时）
2. 命名的tips

新的问题：

1. 第74行代码，如果第6行代码不是4个数据，或者说不是偶数个数据，那样中间的数字就会重复输出。这样是不是要进行预先的length 判定，还是说在最后输出的时候进行删除重复项？但是数据库提取中，这样会无形曾加一组数据出来

2. 老师教下抓包放包，或者有教程推荐吗？中英文都可以，之前自学不是很思想，今天写作业的时候，经常报错
