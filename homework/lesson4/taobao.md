# lesson4_theFourthHomework_codingIdea

There no homework about lesson4, but I know I should and must do this.

The goal of this lecture, the prof would like to share the coding idea which is about thinkking code. The most important point is make your thinking in code. If possible, let it satrts with coding thinking and type the code later.

For the two example during the lecture, the first one, instructor gave three sample codes, and explained first two. I 100% understand those two ideas and deep meaning. However, when I saw the sample3.js code. I got one weak part understanding which is about Object and its property. Moreover, I have more deep understanding about var and defination, and I know that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. 

Then when lecture hant out the second example about prepare for one meal. The instructor point me the code thinking and I make connect with my coding before. Before this course, I studied and wrote code in University, I do not know why prof asked us write like that. Maybe I did not pay attention during the course. However, after I type the kitchen-sample.js code, and I replayed the video. I know more than before. I believe my code is more meaningful and clearly.

In conclusion, this lecture help me lots of thinking about code, and it will change my coding write style. I prefer make all logic first on paper or something then type them in code.

终于听到直播了，

报数的例子问题不大，对于使用对象进行报数的 sample3.js 看过后已经理解，但是更倾向于 sample1.js 和 sample2.js 的写法，当然相信 sample3.js 的写法也是会有用的，现在没有用到罢了。

做菜的例子上课听的时候，第一反映是懵逼的，后面看代码的时候发现老师的写法让很多东西进行了有效的使用而不是重复的造轮子，之前在校写的时候很多数据我都是复制粘贴，感觉简单易懂，但是面对复杂的情况下，function  使用过多会造成很多的损耗（人力，维护）。

1. visaul stiduo 真好用 formate 插件，还有好多插件，之前在用 Atom， 里面也有插件但是从来没用过，教授恨不得让我们用notepad 写代码。
2. 老师上课提到的 扫描没有被使用过的代码的脚本 可以推荐吗？（还不能自己Google 哪个最好）
